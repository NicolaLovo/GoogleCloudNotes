# Object Versioning and Lifecycle Management

Objects are immutable during its storage lifetime

- cannot be deleted in-place -> they are replaced
  - the replacement marks the end of the object lifecycle and the beginning of a new one

> [!NOTE]
> Storage lifetime: successful creation - successful delete

## Object versioning

Retains a non-current object version when the live object version gets replaced or deleted

- if enabled it can increase costs
  - can be mitigated by configuring `Object Lifecycle Management` to delete older versions

Version properties -> present even if versioning is not present

- generation -> version of data
- metageneration -> version of metadata

Older-generation objects retain the object name but are uniquely identified by their generation number

> [!NOTE]
> When deleting a current version, the object will be moved in a non-current state. When deleting a non-current version, it will be permanently deleted

## Object Lifecycle Management

- set a Time to Live (TTL) for objects
- delete or archive non-current versions
- downgrade storage class to save money

Use cases:

- downgrade storage class to Coldline Storage for objects older than 365 days
- keep only the 3 most recent versions of each object in a bucket

Lifecycle configuration:

- rules -> set of conditions that ALL need to match for the action to take place
- actions: `Delete` or `SetStorageClass`

If multiple rules are satisfied simultaneously on the same object:

- `Delete` takes precedence over `SetStorageClass`
- `SetStorageClass` with the lowest at-rest pricing takes precedence

> [!NOTE]
> Lifecycle rules take up to 24 hours to take effect

> [!IMPORTANT]
> An object's storage class can be moved only "Backwards" with lifecycle. Nearline > Coldline > Archive, never the opposite(like from Archive to Coldline)
