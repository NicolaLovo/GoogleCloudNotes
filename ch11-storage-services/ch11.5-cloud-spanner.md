DBaaS -> Database as a Service

Fully managed relational database that is strongly consistent and horizontally scalable

- **strongly consistent** -> data is passed to all replicas as soon a write request is received by one replica

- supports schemas, ACID transactions and SQL queries
- uses **true time** -> HA, distributed atomic clock service provided to all apps in Google Cloud
  - provides a timestamp to each transaction
- Globally distributed relational database
  - handles replicas and sharding
  - synchronous data replication
- automatic scaling and node redundancy
- up to 99.999% availability
- data layer encryption, audit logging, IAM integration
- designed to financial services, global supply chain
- pricing: 0.9$/node/hour + 0.3/GB/month

## Architecture

Instance creation:

- instance configuration -> permanent
  - geographic location: regional or multi-region
- node count -> can be changed if needed
  - can't configure the individual node CPU/memory. If more power is needed, add another node
  - 3 nodes minimum recommended in production

Regional configuration:

- 3 read/write replica in 3 different zones in the same region
  - each replica is a full copy of the database

## Sharding

Called also "Split"

- create replicas of each database split to increase performance and availability
- all data of a split is stored in a replica
- for each ReplicaSet, one is elected as Leader Replica
  - handles writes, other serve read requests

## Performance

Each node can provide

- up to 10000 QPS(Query Per Second) of reads or 2000 QPS of writes
- up to 2TB of storage

Add nodes to increase throughput

- can be scaled automatically using Cloud Monitoring metrics that trigger Cloud Functions

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Adding a node does not increase the number of replicas, but the resources available to each replica

## Sequential IDs and Hot spots

Using sequential IDs as primary keys can lead to the new rows being written to the same node in the database, creating a "hot spot". A hot spot is a node that receives more requests than others, leading to performance degradation.

A solution is to use a **randomized ID** as primary key, or to use a **UUID**.
