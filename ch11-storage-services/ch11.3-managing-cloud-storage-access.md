# Demo

`gsutil` -> tool to manage Cloud storage

- `gsutil cp hello.txt gs://mybucket` -> copy file to the bucket in location `gs://mybucket/hello.txt`
  - `gsutil cp hello.txt gs://mybucket/my/path/file.txt` -> copy file to custom location in the bucket

## Making a bucket public

Useful only when serving static websites, normally a bucket should be kept private

- turn off public access prevention
- add Permission to `allUsers` with the level of access wanted
  - es. `Storage Object Viewer`

Now files can be accessed with their url on the internet

## Create a signed url

Allows who has the url to access a resource in a bucket without needing to authenticate.

_Access_ could mean download, update, delete, **but also upload new files** to the bucket.

1. create a service account(we need a private key for the signature)
   1. Assign permissions to access Cloud storage (e.g. `Storage Object Viewer`)
   2. Create a new [JSON private key](ch11.3-managing-cloud-storage-access.key.json) that will be downloaded
2. `gsutil signurl -d 10m privateKey.json gs://myBucket/path/to/resource.txt`
   1. Note: `pyopenssl` is needed to run this command -> `pip3 install pyopenssl`
   2. `-d 10m` -> time validity of the url

## Versioning

- `gsutil versioning get gs://${bucket}` -> see if versioning is enabled for this bucket
- `gsutil versioning set on gs://${bucket}` -> enable versioning
  - `gsutil versioning set off gs://${bucket}` -> disable versioning

Demo:

- delete file -> gets converted to a non-current state
  - still shows up in `gsutil ls -a gs://${bucket}`
  - after each file name there is its generation id
- restore non-current version: `gsutil mv gs://${bucket}/${file}#${generationNumber} gs://${targetBucket}/${targetFile}`
  - using the mv command deletes the non-current version and creates a new file with a new generation number
  - use `cp` to keep the non-current and create a new file with a new generation

### Edit lifecycle json

- `gsutil lifecycle get gs://${bucket} > lifecycle.json` -> output the current lifecycle policies on a file
- `gsutil lifecycle set lifecycle.json gs://${bucket}`
