# NoSQL databases

## Bigtable

Wide-column(schemaless) NoSQL database

- designed for PetaByte, low latency
  - store large amounts of single-keyed data
  - sort of OLTP database
- built for real-time app serving and large-scale analytical workloads --> *live database*
- regional services
  - has automated replication for durability
- add nodes when you need them
  - cluster resizing without downtime
- integrates with big data tools: `hadoop`, `dataproc`, `dataflow`, `apache hbase`
- high price

- time-series, IoT data
- marketing, financial data
- recommendation engines

Used in Google search, Maps and Gmail.

Similar to Cassandra, HBase.

## Cloud Datastore

**Deprecated in 2021 in favor of Firestore**

NoSQL document database built for automatic scaling, high performance

- redundancy in the chosen location -> HA of reads and writes
- atomic transactions
- automatic scaling
- SQL-like query language called *GQL* 
  - strong and eventual consistency
- encryption at Rest -> data is encrypted when written to disk
- provides local emulation of the production database environment
  - is a component of the `gcloud` tool

## Firestore for Firebase

- flexible, scalable NoSQL database
- store data in documents -> stored in collections
- serverless service
- automatic multi-region replication
- 5 9s availability
- realtime updates and offline support
- free tier + paid tier

### Realtime Database

Simpler version of Firestore

### Firebase

Mobile app development platform -> provides tool and services to speed up development

## Memorystore

Provides Redis or Memcached in-memory data store to build caches

For Redis:

- high availability with replication
- scale as needed

Use cases:

- caching
- stream processing
