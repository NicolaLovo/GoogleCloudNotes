# Cloud functions

FaaS -> Function as a Service

Serverless execution environment

- provisioning of resources happens only when code is executing
- run in a Runtime: Python, Java, Nodejs, Go, .NET core
- event-driven -> execute code in response to events(triggers):
  - HTTP
  - Pub/Sub
  - Cloud Storage
  - Firebase, Firestore
- billing: time + resources provisioned to function
  - include a free tier

## How Cloud functions work

Trigger: event that calls the function

- passes parameters to the function

Settings:

- memory
- networking preferences
  - by default cloud functions can access the public internet, but not the VPC
- service account
- allow public internet access

Types of cloud functions:

- HTTP functions
  - invoked through HTTP requests
  - support handling common HTTP methods
  - TLS certificate automatically provisioned
- background functions
  - handle events from GCP infrastructure

At Code deployment:

- trigger binds to the function
  - only 1 trigger can be bound to a function
- source code is stored as a .zip in cloud storage bucket
  - cloud build automatically builds a container image from that code
  - the image is pushed to cloud registry
- the function accesses the image when it needs to be executed

At invocation:

- a request may be assigned to an existing instance or create a new one
- one instance can handle only 1 request at a time
  - assign resources needed for 1 request
- once the function is run it is deleted -> stateless service

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When deleting a cloud function delete also the storage buckets that were automatically created for it

## Commands

`gcloud functions describe ${functionName}` -> describe a function

`gcloud functions deploy ${functionName} --trigger-http --runtime ${runtime}` -> deploy a function with an HTTP trigger
