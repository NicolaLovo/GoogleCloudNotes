# Operations suite

Formerly known as `Stackdriver`

Suite of tools for logging, monitoring and app diagnostics

- available for GCP and AWS(connect to AWS with an AWS role and GCP service account)
- monitor VMs with agents
- available for on-premises and hybrid environments
- can integrate with other technologies

## Services

### Monitoring

Collects metrics to understand how apps are performing

- displays data through predefined dashboards 
  - can create custom dashboards
- workspaces are needed to use cloud monitoring -> best practice to use a multi-project workspace to monitor all from one place
- agents are recommended to monitor VMs to gain detailed metrics
- works together with *Cloud Logging*
- support to monitor GKE
- define alert policies to receive notifications (email, sms, 3rd party tools)
  - up to 500 policies per workspace
  - 3 conditions for a policy: metric + behavior + period of time

### Cloud Logging

Central repository for log data from multiple sources

- logging can come from other environments other than GCP
- tight integration with Cloud Monitoring
- logs can be exported to other sources
  - archive storage
  - big query for analysis

Concepts:

- Log Viewer: shows logs associated to a GPC project
- Log Entry: record a status or an event
- Logs: named collection of log entries within a GCP resource
- Retention Period: how long logs are kep

Types of logs:

- Audit Logs -> who did what, where and when
- Access Transparency Logs -> actions taken by Google Staff
  - es. when google staff accesses data for a support ticket
- Agent Logs -> logs from agents in VMs


### Error Reporting

Real-time error monitoring and alerting

- counts, analyzes and aggregates all errors in GCP
- sends notifications

### Debugger

Debugs a running application without slowing it down

- captures and inspects call stack, local variables
  - takes a *snapshot* of the app
- *Logpoints* allow to inject logging into running services
- can be hooked into a remote Git repo(es. Github)
- can be installed also in non-GCP environments

### Trace

Understand how long it takes for an app to handle incoming requests(latancy)

### Profiler

Continuously gathers CPU, memory usage from apps

- discover patterns of resource consumption
- low-profile -> does not consume much resources
- needs a profiling agent to be installed
