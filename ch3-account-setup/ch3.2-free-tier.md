# Create free tier account

2 approaches:

- Free tier: 12 month free trial with 300$, **cannot** be a business account
- Always free: always free, with limited access, if limits are hit you will be charged. Cannot be used in conjunction with the free tier, need to have an **upgraded billing account**(can be business)

## Free Tier

What's needed

- new gmail address
- credit card for verification
- Private browsing session(es. ingognito mode in chrome)

My free trial account: victor.boltzmann@gmail.com
